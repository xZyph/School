    <h2>CMS</h2>
    <p>
      CMS is an abbreviation for <strong>Content Management System</strong>. This is a system created specifically for the management of digital content.
      Usually these systems allow for several users to collaborate on publishing content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some prime examples of common CMSs are <strong>Wordpress</strong>, <strong>Joomla</strong>, <strong>Drupal</strong> and <strong>Expression Engine</strong>.

      Allthough there are some great advantages to using these systems, there are still a few drawbacks. Not having to code it all on your own, is definately
      one of the most appealing factors, but it's also really easy and intuitive to use. Should you however have any need for advanced customization, you
      would have to obtain specialized knowledge on how to do so properly. This may very well be time consuming.
