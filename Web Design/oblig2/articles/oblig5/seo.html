    Search engines these days more or less rule the web, and it's more important than ever to
    produce websites that are optimized for these search engines. <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>
    will make or break a website in it's attempt to go viral. One of the main resons for this is that we all
    use the mighty search engines for absolutely everything. Not that this is a bad thing at all, as it puts 
    pressure on us developers to continuously expand our knowledge.

    I get the feeling that most people find it quite frustrating to implement these techniques,
    and many may overlook the many positive consequenses of doing so. 
    Using some extra time to properly write your code, and making sure it is technically up to the standards,
    is an investment you simply cannot afford to miss. 
    Not only does your website most likely increase it's traffic by orders of magnitude,
    you also make the website way more accessible.

    While developing I am usually not that good at continuously check for errors,
    and was therefore quite surprised to find that I've managed to score 100/100 in
    the Lighthouse extension for the Chrome web browser.

    As a part of this assignment, we had to check out previous work to assess what
    we could do differently in regards to <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.
    The problem however, is that the screenshot I have supplied is almost identical to the score I initially got.

    There are a ton of good applications and services out on the world wide web, that help with determining
    what needs to be changed in your code, and even some that tell you exactly what is wrong.
