    <h2>Universal Design</h2>
    <p>Universal design is a concept that the things we create should be equally accessible to everyone, regardless of any disability.</p>
    <p>
      When creating websites, we have to develop with certain techniques to make it accessible to everyone. An extra bonus is that
      many of the web development concepts that we use for accessiblity, are used by search engines in page rankings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for screen readers and other technologies to read our website, we have to keep the HTML part as clean and semantic as we 
      possibly can. The semantic structure of the HTML document is crucial in giving meaning to our code, so that clever programs may
      use this information to literally help people enjoy your hard work as a web developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important step in making a website accessible, is to think about the design itself.
      It's painfully obvious, but also easy to forget that many of us struggle to differentiate between some colors.
      Because of this we should for example keep a high contrast between text and it's background.

      I could go on about this for quite a while, but since time is of the essence, I shant.
