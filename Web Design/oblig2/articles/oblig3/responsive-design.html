  <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Media Queries</strong> are what we use to define rulesets for different situations. 
    We use these to set custom rulesets for printers, different devices and is capable of much more.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Media Types</strong> are the actual device the CSS is meant for. Amongst others we have important media types like <i>screen</i> and <i>print</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    With both CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid we are able to achieve <strong>Flexible Sizing</strong>, which allows elements to easily take up fractions of space. 
    The flexible sizing allows us to create websites that naturally resize and fit the media you are viewing it on.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Font Sizing</strong> is also a very underestimated tool for building responsive websites. By using the <i>em</i> unit to set paddings and margins,
    all of the spacing will depend on the root font size. This means that by just changing the font size in the media query, you will also change the spacing.
    Please note that I sadly haven't implemented this functionality on this website, but perhaps the next one?
