  <h2>Github</h2>
  <p><strong>Git</strong> is a version control system that allows us developers to track changes in our files.</p>
  <p>With <strong>Git</strong> we can also coordinate several people working on the same project, by keeping track of every change made in any of the files.</p>
  <p><strong>Github</strong> on the other hand is an online service based upon <strong>Git</strong>. This massive online codebase has a fantastic website for viewing and sharing all that code.</p>
