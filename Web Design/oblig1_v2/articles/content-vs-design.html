<h1 class="title">Content vs. Design</h1>
<hr>
<p>When designing a website, developers are often challenged with the hard decision. Should my design fit the content, or should the content fit the design?</p>
<p>
  There are probably millions of good examples to use here, as some websites focus more on the design aspect, while others don't even have anything close to what we think of as design.
  Usually though, websites need to have a good mix of both to become a sucessful site.
</p>
<p>
  I cannot come to a conclusion to which should prioritized over the other, but it's obvious that no matter how good your content is, 
  if your design doesn't structure this content in a good way, it'll be terribly hard to read. And who would like to browse a website that looks amazing,
  but really have no content at all?
</p>
<p>My own personal workflow is to try and get an overview of all the content that is absolutely essential, and then make a design that can present this in the most attractive way possible.</p>
