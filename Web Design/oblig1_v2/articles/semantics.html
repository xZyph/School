<hr>
<p>Semantic tags were created with multiple purposes in mind. They help us mortals read code easier, but most importantly it lets computers understand the purpose of different blocks of content.</p>
<p>The latter is immensely effective in regards to search engines and their task of categorizing all websites by their content, as opposed to the old way of using custom id's and classnames as illustrated below.</p>
