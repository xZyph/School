<p>Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Noooooo!</p>
<p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. <strong> Hey, tell me something.</strong> <em> You've got all this money.</em> How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
<h2>Take me to your leader!</h2>
<p>Bender, you risked your life to save me! Daylight and everything. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>
<ol>

    <li>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</li><li>You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!</li><li>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</li>

</ol>

<h3>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</h3>
<p>Shut up and get to the point! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? No, she'll probably make me do it.</p>
<ul>

    <li>We're rescuing ya.</li><li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</li><li>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</li>

</ul>

<p>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
